## Homepage Trial Funnel

The homepage implementation is labeled `trial-focused-v1`. In Umami, use the
ordered events `Homepage Viewed` → `Trial CTA Clicked` → `Signup Viewed` →
`Trial Started`. Homepage and CTA events include the variant; CTA events also
include placement. Signup includes only allowlisted homepage campaign query values.
Existing `CTA Clicked - Cloud` and `Cloud Trial - Header` events remain for
historical comparisons.

The website and Cloud app use the same Umami website ID and `/stats/api/send`
proxy. After deploying both, verify a consent-denied signup journey in Umami
before relying on cross-domain funnel percentages. IP/browser changes and session
expiry can split a journey. PostHog receives the same event names only with consent.
Production-host checks exclude local Umami funnel events and website custom events.

`Trial Started` retains its existing meaning: a newly created backend account
observed during app startup within 15 minutes of account creation, deduplicated
per device. It does not mean the user created or funded a budget. Compare equal
date windows and homepage cohorts; total sitewide trials divided by homepage CTA
clicks is not a valid conversion rate.

Run `pnpm run test:analytics` for delayed-tracker, queue-limit, and provider-failure
checks. App funnel URL filtering has separate tests in
`packages/app/src/shared/lib/analytics/umami.test.ts`.

## Publishing Content

### Blog Posts

1. Create `content/blog/my-post.mdx` with frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: "My Post"
   date: "2026-05-28"
   author: "Your Name"
   ---
   ```
2. Add an excerpt to `src/lib/blog-data.ts`
3. Build — the post auto-generates at `/blog/my-post`

### Docs/Guides

1. Create `content/docs/my-guide.mdx` with frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: "My Guide"
   section: "getting-started"
   topicId: "my-guide"
   takeaways:
     - "Key point 1"
     - "Key point 2"
   published: true
   ---
   ```
2. Build — the guide auto-generates at `/docs/my-guide`

## Adding Changelog Entries

Edit `src/lib/changelog-data.ts` and add a new `ChangelogEntry`:

```ts
{
  version: 'v1.X.Y',
  date: 'Month D, YYYY',
  summary: 'Short description of the release.',
  isLatest: true,  // unset isLatest on previous entry
  items: [
    { type: 'new', title: 'Feature name', description: '...' },
    { type: 'fixed', title: 'Bug fix', description: '...' },
  ],
}
```
